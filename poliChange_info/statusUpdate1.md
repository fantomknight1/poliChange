#50% update

At this point I'm not as far as I want to be.  I have been spending a lot of time working with the backend trying to get my api to play nicely with my backend database.  At this point I have shifted gears and will be focusing on the front end and making sure I can establish a connection from the front end to the back end.  

Since the switch I have made great progress on the front end and am now rendering stuff in react to the front.  I should be close to implementing the user page and the search fields next.

I will focus on finishing the front end and setting up dummy data to pass to the front so that I can ensure D3 renders what I need properly.  I will save the API for last.

I would say at this point I am about 35% of the way through which is behind my target.  I have been rapidly making up time with success on the front end but until then I am going to be limiting the amount of data that I will render on my charts to just the total income from donations.
